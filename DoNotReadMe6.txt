# GAME TITLE: Kothi No. 17

## PROLOGUE: THE COSMIC JOKE
**VISUAL:** Pitch black screen.
**AUDIO:** A deep, booming, authoritative voice (reminiscent of the old Mahabharat TV show).

**SAMAY (V.O.):**
*"Main Samay Hoon..." (I am Time).*
*"I have witnessed the birth of stars. I have seen the silence before the Big Bang."*
**(Sound of a massive explosion. Fast montage: Dinosaurs roaring, The Pyramids being built, The Kurukshetra War, The British leaving India via train).**
*"I have seen Empires rise from dust and return to dust. I hold the wisdom of the ages..."*

**(Sound of a Record Scratch. Silence.)**
**VISUAL:** Cut to a messy, dim 1RK apartment in Mumbai/Pune. A ceiling fan wobbles noisily (*Krrr-krrr*).
**RAMESH (26)** sits in his underwear, staring at a laptop screen. He is scraping the bottom of a Maggi cup.
**Screen Text:** *“Dear Candidate, regarding your application... No.”*

**SAMAY (V.O.) (Sarcastic tone):**
*"And then... there is Ramesh. Bank Balance: ₹412. Future Prospects: Zero. Ambition: To pay rent before the landlord kicks him out."*

**CUT TO:**
**EXT. TEA STALL - DAY**
Ramesh is depressed. A sleek black car pulls up. A man in a sharp suit (**THE STRANGER**) steps out. He doesn’t blink. He sits opposite Ramesh.

**STRANGER:**
"You look like a man who needs an opportunity."

**RAMESH:**
"I need a job, sir. Any job."

**STRANGER:**
"My clients have purchased the old **Raichand Kothi** in Rajasthan. It has been empty for 40 years. We need a caretaker for one month to clean it before the renovation crew arrives. Payment: ₹50,000 cash."

**RAMESH:**
"Done. When do I start?"

---

## ACT 1: THE ARRIVAL (DAYS 1-5)
**Objective:** Establish the Atmosphere & The Mundane Routine.

**EXT. VILLAGE - DAY**
Ramesh arrives. The village is colorful but quiet.
**GAMEPLAY:** Ramesh walks to the General Store.
**SHOPKEEPER (KAKA):** "New to the village, son?"
**RAMESH:** "Yes, Kaka. I’m the new watchman for the Raichand Kothi."
**(The bustling shop goes silent. Villagers stare.)**
**KAKA:** "Go back. The last three didn't last a week. That house... it doesn't want to be cleaned."
**RAMESH:** "I need the money, Kaka. Just give me bread and milk."

**EXT. THE KOTHI - EVENING**
Ramesh approaches the gate. The Kothi is massive, beautiful, but covered in vines and dust.
**SAMAY (V.O.):** *"The gates open. The trap shuts. But he thinks it's just a rusty hinge."*

**INT. KOTHI - NIGHT**
**GAMEPLAY LOOP (THE ROUTINE):**
* **Task:** Pick up trash. Dust the furniture.
* **Mechanic:** The house is huge. You have a flashlight (battery drains). You must sleep to save the game.

**EXPLORATION (DIARY #1 FOUND):**
Under a broken chair in the smoking area, Ramesh finds a crumpled note.
**Text (Bunty, Watchman, 1995):** *"Day 3. Easy money. Villagers are superstitious fools. But... why is it so cold in the hallway? And I swear I left my cigarettes on the table, but I found them in the sink. Rats, probably."*

**RAMESH:** "Heh. Amateur."

---

## ACT 2: THE STORM & THE CAMERA (DAYS 6-12)
**Objective:** The supernatural elements begin.

**EXT. KOTHI - NIGHT**
Ramesh tries to go to the village. A violent, purple-hued storm rages at the gate.
**RAMESH:** "Kaka will be closed in this weather."
He steps back. He looks through the gate. **The village is dry. The moon is shining there.** The storm is *only* inside the boundary.

**INT. STORE ROOM**
The wind breaks a window. Ramesh rushes to fix it. Under the wet floorboards, he finds the **RUSTED BOX**.
**Contents:**
1.  **A Black & White Photo (1984):** A Couple, a Child, and **The Stranger**. The Stranger looks *exactly* the same as he did yesterday.
2.  **A Super-8 Video Camera:** It looks broken, but the red light blinks.

**GAMEPLAY MECHANIC UNLOCKED:**
Ramesh raises the Camera.
**Viewfinder:** The room is not dusty. It is golden, warm, and new. It is 1984.

**THE SCARE:**
Ramesh pans the camera to the corner. In the viewfinder, **The Stranger** is standing there, staring directly at the lens.
Ramesh lowers the camera in panic. The corner is empty.

**EXPLORATION (DIARY #2 FOUND):**
Hidden inside a hollow book in the Library.
**Text (Professor Rao, Watchman/Architect, 2010):** *"The Entity is not a ghost. It is a parasite. It feeds on the repetition of tragedy. I call him The Collector. He cannot be seen with eyes, only through a lens. I have started mapping the anomalies. The house remembers."*

---

## ACT 3: THE ANOMALIES (DAYS 13-20)
**Objective:** Use the Camera to solve puzzles and learn the truth.

**RAMESH'S GOAL:** The Stranger calls the landline (which shouldn't work).
**STRANGER (Phone):** *"The guests are coming, Ramesh. Prepare the dinner table."*

**PUZZLE 1: THE DINING ROOM**
* **Task:** Set the table.
* **Problem:** You don't know the arrangement.
* **Solution:** Use the **Camera**. Look at the past. You see the **Ghost Mother** placing plates.
* **Audio (Through Camera):**
    * *Mother:* "Anand, are you sure about this deal?"
    * *Father:* "We need the money, Sunita. The man said he just wants the deed signed. We leave tomorrow."
* **Ramesh's Thought:** "My God... they didn't know they were never leaving."

**EXPLORATION (DIARY #3 FOUND):**
Scratched into the wall of the attic.
**Text (The First Watchman, 1984):** *"I am not a watchman. I am the father. I hid the boy. I hid Ramesh in the truck. If you are reading this... the gas pipe. The fire wasn't an accident. He (The Stranger) loosened the valve. I tried to fix it but he broke my leg. Save us."*

**RAMESH:**
"Ramesh... he hid... me?"
(Ramesh pulls out the locket he wears. He looks at the Photo in the box. The father is wearing the same locket.)

---

## ACT 4: THE PREPARATION (DAYS 21-29)
**Objective:** Alter the house in the Present to save the Past.

**RAMESH:** "I'm not cleaning this house for him. I'm cleaning it for them."

**GAMEPLAY LOOP (THE FIX):**
Ramesh ignores the Stranger's orders. He follows the Father's Diary clues.

1.  **The Kitchen:**
    * Ramesh finds the gas pipe. It is rusted solid.
    * He needs a **Heavy Wrench**.
    * *Retrieval:* He has to backtrack to the garden shed (scary area) to find the wrench.
    * *Action:* He oils and tightens the valve in the Present.

2.  **The Escape Route:**
    * The Front Door is jammed by a fallen chandelier in the Present.
    * *Action:* Ramesh spends 3 in-game days chopping the debris with the **Axe** (purchased in Act 1).
    * *Result:* The path is clear.

3.  **The Key:**
    * The Bedroom door was locked in 1984, trapping the child.
    * *Camera View:* The Father threw the key into the Aquarium in panic.
    * *Action:* Ramesh breaks the dried-up, dirty aquarium in the present. He finds the key. He unlocks the door.

**SAMAY (V.O.):**
*"The stage is set. The actors are ready. But the script... has been rewritten."*

---

## ACT 5: THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE (DAY 30)
**Objective:** The Final Loop.

**TIME: 8:15 PM.**
The Storm stops. The silence is deafening.
The **Ghost Family** manifests. They are glowing faint blue.
The **Stranger (Entity)** manifests. He is a towering shadow of static.

**ENTITY:**
*"Begin the play! Burn!"*

**THE CLIMAX (No Combat, Pure Tension):**
1.  **The Kitchen:** The Mother walks to the stove. She strikes a match.
    * *Anticipation:* The Entity smiles, waiting for the boom.
    * *Result:* The flame lights. No explosion. The gas valve is tight (because Ramesh fixed it). The Mother looks confused but calm.

2.  **The Bedroom:** The Child wakes up, smelling smoke (phantom smell). He runs to the door.
    * *Result:* The door is unlocked. He runs out.

3.  **The Hallway:** The Entity realizes the loop is broken. He screams (digital screeching). The house begins to shake.
    * **Action:** The Stranger tries to block the exit. He is invisible to the ghosts.
    * **Ramesh's Move:** Ramesh raises the **Camera**.
    * **Mechanic:** He holds `Right Click` to charge the flash. **FLASH!**
    * The light stuns the Entity, revealing him to the Ghosts.
    * **Ramesh Shouts:** "RUN! OUT THE DOOR! GO!"

**THE ESCAPE:**
The Father sees the open door. He grabs the Mother and Child.
They run.
They cross the threshold of the Kothi.
**VISUAL:** As they cross the gate, they turn into bright balls of light and shoot up into the sky.

**THE COLLAPSE:**
The Entity, starving and defeated, implodes. The Kothi, held together only by the time loop, begins to crumble rapidly.
Ramesh sprints. The roof is falling. He dives through the window.

---

## EPILOGUE: THE MORNING AFTER
**EXT. RUINS - DAY**
Birds are chirping. The Kothi is a pile of ancient stones.
Ramesh is lying in the grass, covered in dust, alive.

**KAKA (Shopkeeper):**
"Oh my god! Boy! I saw the collapse! I thought you were dead!"

**RAMESH:**
(Coughs) "I... I finished the job, Kaka. The house is clean."

**KAKA:**
"Clean? It's gone!"

Ramesh reaches into his pocket. He pulls out the **Rusted Box**.
He opens it.
**The Photo:**
The Stranger is gone.
The Father, Mother, and Baby are standing there. They are smiling. The Father is holding a sign in the photo: *"Live, Son."*

**RAMESH:**
He checks his phone.
*Notification:* **Payment Failed. Employer not found.**

Ramesh laughs. A tired, happy laugh. He stands up and dusts off his pants.
He feels something heavy in his other pocket.
He pulls it out.
It is the **Solid Gold Pocket Watch** from the Ghost Father's vest.

**RAMESH:**
"Severance package."

**VISUAL:**
Camera pans up from Ramesh walking away, up to the blue sky, then to the stars.

**SAMAY (V.O.):**
*"Time creates circles. Humans create lines. And sometimes... just sometimes... a janitor becomes a savior. Ramesh didn't get his 50,000 rupees. But he got a future."*

**(Boom Emoji Sound Effect)**
**SAMAY:**
*"Okay, cut. Who's next? Ah... a software engineer in Bangalore? Boring. Next!"*

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END.**
