starts from big bang and mahabharat - main samay hu, boom emoji, funny speech and then fast forward to current time where a man is shown and he lost his job because of layoffs then he got into some financial issues he tries to get another job but he couldnt then a random guy comes in front of him and asks him he want to take a watchman job at a kothi in rajasthan village and he agrees.... then he goes there and gets tasks like he should roam in the kothi explore a bit about it and turn on the lights etc clean it because after a month some ppl are arriving to live there.... then he explores the village and buys things for the kothi and also talks to ppl in village and tells he is watchman in the kothi and they react very weirdly and say that the kothi is abandoned for years now then why... so he tells that he got laid off then smone very kind offered him the job after seeing his poor condition and asks if he could get a house somewhere to stay.... the shopkeeper asks him to take care of himself and just stops talking.... he comes back to the kothi and a cutscene is shown that there is a storm in the village ( he thinks that the storm is in village but in reality the storm is near kothi only ) kothi's few windows break....
