now he has to do some tasks like picking up the trash dust the furnitures... he founds a flashlight in the house too low battery in it....

he finds a note under a broken chair in the smoking area by a previous watchman **Text (Bunty, Watchman, 1995):** "Day 3. Easy money. Villagers are superstitious fools. But... why is it so cold in the hallway? And I swear I left my cigarettes on the table, but I found them in the sink. Rats, probably."
**ramesh:** "Heh. Amateur."

ACT 2 days ( 6-12 )

it was a rainy night so ramesh slept inside the haveli and the next day when h goes to the village and says to the shopkeeper kaka it rained so much yesterday and he says what do you mean it rained so much yesterday it is month of may it doesnt rain in may and in rajasthan definitely not kaka takes it as satire and leaves it then he gets his stuff from the store goes back to the haveli does his work but tonight at the haveli it wasnt just raining but storm too but when ramesh looked outside in the village it was all dry no storm not even a single drop of rain nothing he gets a bit scared and suddenly a sound comes glass window shattered now he has to fix the windows but while fixing them he sees a mysterious rusted box there he tries to open it but needs a key he doesnt have so he has to find it in the house and after opening he finds a picture in the picture there is a family but with the family one more person is there who looks familiar the stranger but the thing is he looks the same in picture as he looked yesterday he hasnt aged for 40 years or wot?? but along with the photo there is a camera a super-8 video camera it looks broken no batteries inside but it seems to be working the light in it blinks... he raises the camera the room is not dusty anymore it is golden, warm and new. ramesh pans the camera on a corner in the viewfinder he sees the stranger is standing there staring directly at the lens as he can see ramesh using camera... ramesh lowers the camera in panic and the corner is empty there is noone around.

act 3 ( find anomalies )

use the camera to solve puzzles find anomalies and learn the truth.


ramesh finds "glitches" in the house. When he films specific spots (like the fireplace or the garden swing), the Camera plays audio flashbacks.
He hears the Stranger talking to the Father in 1984.
"The contract is simple, Mr. Raichand. You get the wealth, I get the time. But if you leave the house... the deal is void."*
The Stranger isn't a human. He is a Collector. He makes deals with desperate people (like the Father, and now ramesh). He traps them in the Kothi to feed on their time.


the stranger calls the landaline which shouldnt work as it is not connected the wire is broken.
ramesh picks the call and the stranger says the guests are coming prepare the dinner table for 4 people, play this music and wind the time in grandfather clock to 8:15pm ( the clock doesnt seem to work)

it was just day 20 ramesh does all these things but no one arrives that day so he thinks maybe the mood changed they might arrive tmrw he sleeps wakes up does the daily tasks and finds a diary of the first watchman he has written ---------.  and in evening stranger calls again asks to do the same he does it again noone arrives

------cant think of middle part-----


now finally it was day 30 he did the same thing again and this time guests arrived but they weren't humans they weren't ghosts but echoes from the past they ate they danced and then when ramesh sees it using camera in the kitchen stranger was setting up fire for the blast they were memories being recreated now when ramesh realised he could interact too in the world not just see like if he does something now it reflects the same in past and he has to save the family and then fight with stranger
