You are absolutely right. The **Time Camera** is the perfect mechanic to bridge the gap between "boring cleaning tasks" and "solving the mystery." It gives the player a tool to interact with the supernatural elements actively.

Here is the updated story structure, integrating the **Time Camera** as the core gameplay mechanic.

### Title Idea: *Shutter: The Kothi*

---

### Part 1 & 2: The Setup (Same as before)
* **Intro:** "Main Samay Hoon" (Funny/Epic).
* **Status:** Ramesh is broke, takes the job from the mysterious Stranger.
* **Arrival:** Villagers think he is crazy; he enters the Kothi.
* **Initial Gameplay:** Basic cleaning. The house is scary but quiet.

---

### Part 3: The Storm & The Box (The Turning Point)
**The Storm:**
The supernatural storm hits. A window breaks. Ramesh finds the **Rusted Box** under the floorboards.

**Inside the Box:**
1.  **The Photo:** The family with the Stranger (who hasn't aged).
2.  **The Object:** An old, heavy **Super-8 Video Camera** (or a vintage Analog Camera).
    * Ramesh picks it up. It looks broken. No battery.
    * **The Spark:** Suddenly, the red "Recording" light blinks on by itself.
    * **The Mechanic:** When Ramesh raises the camera to his eye (Right Click), the viewfinder doesn't show the dusty, ruined room. **It shows the room exactly as it was in 1984.** Clean, bright, and full of life.

---

### Part 4: The Dual Reality (Core Gameplay)
Now the game opens up. Ramesh realizes the Kothi exists in two states: **The Dead Present** and **The Living Past**.

**Mechanic 1: Finding Missing Items**
* **Problem:** Ramesh needs a key to open the Master Bedroom. It’s gone in the present.
* **Solution:** He looks through the **Camera**.
    * *In the Camera View:* He sees the Father (ghostly echo) walking in 1984. The Father hides the key inside a hollow book on the shelf.
    * *Action:* Ramesh puts the camera down. The book is rotten in the present, but he opens it and finds the rusty key.

**Mechanic 2: The "Anomaly" Scares**
* Ramesh is walking down a hallway. It feels empty.
* He raises the Camera to check for clues.
* *In the Camera View:* There is a shadowy figure standing **right in front of him**, staring into the lens.
* *Reaction:* He lowers the camera in panic. The hall is empty.
* *Lesson:* The Camera reveals things that are watching him. He has to use it carefully.

### Part 5: The Stranger's Secret
Ramesh tries to leave, but the Storm traps him. He decides to use the Camera to investigate the "Stranger" from the photo.

**The Tape Clues:**
Ramesh finds "glitches" in the house. When he films specific spots (like the fireplace or the garden swing), the Camera plays audio flashbacks.
* **Audio:** He hears the Stranger talking to the Father in 1984.
* **Dialogue:** *"The contract is simple, Mr. Raichand. You get the wealth, I get the time. But if you leave the house... the deal is void."*
* **Realization:** The Stranger isn't a human. He is a **Collector**. He makes deals with desperate people (like the Father, and now Ramesh). He traps them in the Kothi to feed on their time.

### Part 6: The "Guests" Arrive (The Loop)
The month ends. The "Guests" (the Ghost Family) arrive for the final loop.

**The twist with the Camera:**
Ramesh realizes he can't just watch. He has to change the recording.
* The family is acting out the night of the fire.
* **The Puzzle:** In the present, the door to the outside is jammed by debris.
* **The Solution:** Ramesh looks through the Camera. In the past, the door was blocked by a heavy wooden wardrobe placed by the Father (trying to keep the Stranger out).
* **Interference:** Ramesh cannot move the wardrobe in the past. But he sees that the wardrobe has a weak leg.
* **Action:** In the **Present**, he finds the rotted remains of that wardrobe. He smashes the spot where the leg used to be.
* *The Ripple Effect:* Because time is overlapping in the Kothi, smashing the debris in the present causes the wardrobe in the past to collapse *in the Camera view*.

---

### Part 7: The Climax (Filming the Truth)
The fire starts (The Loop). The Stranger appears, laughing, waiting for them to die again.

**The Final Boss Fight:**
The Stranger is invisible in the real world. He can only be seen through the **Camera**.
* **Gameplay:** Ramesh has to navigate the burning house.
* **Combat:** He must point the Camera at the Stranger. The "Flash" of the camera stuns the entity (Light reveals truth).
* **Objective:** Ramesh must guide the confused Ghost Family to the exit.
    * He uses the Camera to show them the "Safe Path" (overlaying the safe past over the burning present).
    * He shouts: *"Follow the light! Not the heat!"*

### Part 8: The Ending

**The Escape:**
The family runs out. The Stranger tries to grab Ramesh.
Ramesh throws the **Camera** into the heart of the spectral fire.
**BOOM.**
The link is broken. The Camera melts. The Stranger dissolves into smoke, screaming that his collection is ruined.

**The Morning After:**
Ramesh wakes up in the ruins. The storm is gone.
He walks to the village. The Shopkeeper sees him.
* **Shopkeeper:** "You... you survived? No one survives the Raichand Kothi."
* **Ramesh:** He reaches into his pocket. He finds the **Photo**.
    * The Stranger is gone from the picture.
    * The Father in the picture is now holding the Camera.
* **The Reward:** Ramesh checks his phone. A notification pops up.
    * *Bank Alert:* ₹5,00,000 credited.
    * *Sender:* "Raichand Trust (1984)."
    * *Note:* "Severance Pay. Good luck, Ramesh."

**Samay (Voiceover):** *"Time is a camera, my friends. Sometimes you just need to change the lens to see the truth. Ramesh didn't get the job... but he gave them peace. Chal, now let's see what happens to this other guy in Mumbai..."* (Boom emoji sound).
